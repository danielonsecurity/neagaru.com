I design and execute high-impact solutions in **offensive security,
resilient infrastructure, and systems automation**.

With 15+ years of experience breaking and building systems from first
principles, I help organizations uncover critical vulnerabilities,
deploy scalable infrastructure, and develop bespoke tools to solve
their hardest technical challenges.

### Core Expertise

- üîê **Offensive Security:** I uncover vulnerabilities others
  miss. From complex web authentication flows (OAuth, SAML) and API
  logic flaws to low-level reverse engineering and hardware
  exploits. I find the gaps before attackers do.

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Systems Architecture & Automation:** I build secure,
  high-availability systems that last. My expertise covers Linux
  hardening, CI/CD pipeline security (GitLab CI, Docker), and
  clustered infrastructure (GlusterFS, Galera, HAProxy).

- üß† **Custom Tooling & Research:** I create novel solutions for
  unique problems. This includes the [OWASP
  Raider](https://github.com/OWASP/raider) framework for auth testing
  and the [UTMS](https://utms.io/) for programmable time modeling,
  both built on a foundation of Python and LISP.

### Why Work With Me?

- **Proven Impact:** Discoverer of multiple high-impact CVEs in
  widely-used open-source software and commercial products.
- **Builder's Mindset:** I don't just find problems; I understand how
  to fix them because I've built and administered the systems myself.
- **First-Principles Approach:** Deep expertise in core technologies
  (Linux, TCP/IP, C, Python) allows me to solve problems that can't be
  fixed with off-the-shelf tools.
- **Full-Spectrum Skills:** My work spans from web application
  pentesting to custom firmware analysis and hardware hacking.
