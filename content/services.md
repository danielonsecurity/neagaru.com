# What I Offer

I help companies, teams, and individuals solve complex problems across security, automation, and systems design — with deep technical expertise and original tooling.

Whether you're shipping software, scaling infrastructure, or just trying to make sense of time itself, I offer hands-on execution, strategic guidance, and high-trust collaboration.

### 🔐 Offensive Security & Penetration Testing

Get ahead of attackers with surgical, high-signal assessments — not checkbox scans.

- Web & API penetration testing (manual, Burp Suite, custom Python fuzzers)
- Authentication flow reviews: OAuth 2.0, SAML, OpenID Connect
- Full lifecycle: audit → remediation support → retesting
- CVE-quality vulnerability research on request

---

### 🧠 Time Modeling & AI-Driven Automation

Design systems that respect your time and attention.  

- Custom-built **UTMS** deployments for time tracking, habit shaping, and forecasting  
- Founder/exec workflows: time audits, cognitive load mapping, calendar optimization  
- AI/LISP integration into Emacs, shell, terminals, and life

---

### ⚙️ DevOps, Systems Engineering & Infra Security

Build secure, observable, automatable infrastructure from the ground up.

- Linux hardening, CI/CD security, containerized deployments (Docker, hybrid cloud)  
- Secrets management, logging/monitoring, ELK/Prometheus/Nagios setups  
- Puppet, Ansible  — or custom scripting if that’s what it takes

---

### 🧪 Custom R&D & Technical Consulting

I take on unusual, high-leverage problems:  
If you need someone to reverse engineer a system, build an AI that understands your bash history, or architect a zero-click alerting pipeline, I’ll make it happen.

- Security research and exploit development  
- Reverse engineering, protocol analysis  
- Python development, API integrations, internal tools  
- Proof-of-concept automation, one-off agents, edge-case weirdness
