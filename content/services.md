# My Services

I offer a range of specialized services designed to solve complex
challenges in security, infrastructure, and automation. My approach is
hands-on, deeply technical, and tailored to your specific
context—whether you're a startup, a scale-up, or a global enterprise.

### 🔐 Offensive Security & Penetration Testing

Go beyond automated scans with in-depth, manual security assessments
that simulate real-world attackers. I provide clear, actionable
reports and support your team through remediation.

- **Web Application & API Pentesting:** In-depth testing of REST and
  GraphQL APIs, single-page applications, and complex business logic
  using Burp Suite Pro, OWASP ZAP, and custom scripts.
- **Authentication & Authorization Review:** Expert analysis of
  complex auth flows, including OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect (OIDC),
  SAML, and JWT implementations.
- **Infrastructure & Network Pentesting:** Internal and external
  network assessments, firewall rule-set review, and vulnerability
  analysis using tools like Nmap, Metasploit, and Nessus.
- **Secure Code Review & Threat Modeling:** Static analysis (SAST) and
  architectural reviews to identify security flaws before they reach
  production.
- **CVE-Quality Vulnerability Research:** Targeted research projects
  to uncover zero-day vulnerabilities in your core products or
  third-party dependencies.

### ⚙️ Systems Engineering & Infrastructure Security

Build and maintain secure, resilient, and observable infrastructure
grounded in industry best practices and years of hands-on
administrative experience.

- **Linux & OS Hardening:** System hardening for Linux, and BSD-based
  servers, including secure configuration of services, firewalls
  (iptables/nftables), and kernel parameters.
- **Secure CI/CD & DevOps:** Auditing and securing automation
  pipelines (GitLab CI, GitHub Actions) and containerized workflows
  (Docker, Docker Swarm).
- **High Availability (HA) Architecture:** Design and implementation
  of fault-tolerant systems using technologies like HAProxy,
  GlusterFS, and Galera Cluster for databases.
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Setup and administration of monitoring
  stacks like ELK, Nagios, and Prometheus for proactive threat
  detection and performance analysis.

### 🧪 Custom Tooling, R&D, and Automation

For problems that require a unique solution, I design and build
bespoke tools, scripts, and frameworks.

- **Custom Automation Scripts:** Development of scripts in Python,
  Bash, or Hy (LISP) to automate security testing, system
  administration, and complex data processing tasks.
- **Bespoke Tool Development:** Building internal tools, API
  integrations, and proof-of-concept applications, leveraging
  frameworks like FastAPI and Django.
- **UTMS Deployments:** Custom implementation of the Universal Time
  Modeling System to help founders and teams achieve radical
  productivity through programmable, AI-assisted time management.

### 🔬 Specialized Research & Hardware Hacking

I take on unconventional R&D projects that fall outside the scope of
typical consulting.

- **Reverse Engineering:** Analyzing binaries and applications using
  Ghidra, Radare2, and x64dbg to understand their functionality and
  find security weaknesses.
- **Firmware & Embedded Device Analysis:** Extracting and analyzing
  firmware from IoT and embedded devices using tools like `binwalk` to
  identify hidden vulnerabilities.
- **Mobile Security:** Auditing Android applications and systems,
  including analysis of rooted/custom ROM (LineageOS) environments.
- **Hardware & Radio Hacking:** NFC/RFID analysis (Proxmark3), HID
  emulation (Teensy), and SDR-based sniffing for specialized physical
  and wireless assessments.
