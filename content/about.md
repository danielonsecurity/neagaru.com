I’m Daniel Neagaru — a senior penetration tester, systems architect, and the creator of **UTMS**, a radical time modeling system.

For over a decade, I’ve delivered high-impact security and automation across industries, from fintech and transport to public sector and research.

**Certifications include**: OSCP, OSCE, OSWP, WCNA, Scrum Master (PSM-I).  
**Fluent in**: Romanian, English, German, and code.

> My work bridges low-level security, high-level strategy, and the metaphysics of time.
