# Daniel Neagaru  
**Senior Penetration Tester · Systems Architect · Creator of UTMS**

I'm a hands-on security engineer and systems thinker with 10+ years of
experience breaking, building, and optimizing systems — from the
kernel to the cloud.

I've worked with fintech firms, transportation platforms, public
agencies, and startups, helping them identify critical
vulnerabilities, build resilient infrastructure, and unlock radically
new ways to model time, productivity, and human intent.

### 🧠 What I Believe

Technology should empower, not entrap.  
Security should be seamless, not obstructive.  
Time is programmable — and we should treat it that way.

That’s why I created **UTMS**, a universal time modeling system that rethinks how we plan, track, and act in the modern world. It’s AI-assisted, event-driven, and built to integrate deeply with human agency.
