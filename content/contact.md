## Get in Touch

I'm open to collaboration and contribution across domains where technology, autonomy, and systems thinking intersect.

If youâ€™re looking for:

- Freelance or retained **security consulting**
- Help with **automation**, **time modeling**, or building weird tools
- A technical **partner** for a project or product idea
- A **speaker** for your conference, podcast, or internal event
- Custom **training** or workshops on security, automation, or org design

â€” Iâ€™m interested.
